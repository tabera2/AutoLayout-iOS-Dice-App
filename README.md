# AutoLayout Dice

I built this app as one of the daily projects for the udemy course "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" BY Angela Yu.
I used the files provided by the course for the user interaction, however I recreated the user interaction myself which include Autolayout
and also the Swift code. 

# Goal of the app
This app is a showcase of uderstading and implementing the followings concepts;

* Add constraints and understanding how Auto Layout works
* The Swift Timer API
* Pin and Align elements
* Create containers to configure advanced layouts
* Debug auto layout errors
* Use Stack Views to create complex interfaces


# About the app

You can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking your phone. With this app in your pocket, 
youâ€™ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!
